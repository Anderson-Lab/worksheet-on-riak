Edit /etc/riak/riak.conf changing the line that says listener.http.internal = 127.0.0.1:8098 to listener.http.internal = 0.0.0.0:8098.\r\n2. sudo riak start # This start riak running on port 8098.\r\n3. Set up port forwarding in Virtualbox for port 8098 to 8098 just like we did for Jupyterhub, which is under Settings->Networking-Port Forwarding.\r\n\r\n# Questions\r\n1. Create a webpage in Riak in a bucket called test with a key called data210. Set the MIME type to text/html and set the content to a webpage that says Welcome to DATA 210. I love Riak. Once this is done, go to your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8098/test/data210. What do you see?",
